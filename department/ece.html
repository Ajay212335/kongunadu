    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p1>
        The Department commenced in the year 2007 with an intake of 60 in the undergraduate program (B.E) Electronics and Communication Engineering. In the year 2012, the post graduate program (M.E) commenced with an intake of 18 in Applied Electronics and the intake for the B.E program was increased to 120. The permanent affiliation has been received for (B.E) Electronics and Communication Engineering from Anna University Chennai, from the academic year 2016-2017 onwards. In addition, the department has a research centre approved by Anna University, Chennai to enhance the research activities of students and faculty members.

The department has been accredited by NBA during the year 2019 and has been futhur re-accredited during the year 2022.

The department holds 18 university ranks in the undergraduate program and 14 university ranks in post graduate program. A separate laboratory “Centre for signal processing and networking” has been established exclusively for research oriented activities. The department has signed MoUs with industries and R&D Institutions. The curriculum of B.E. (Electronics and Communication Engineering) program offered by the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering under Academic Regulation 2020 is prepared in accordance with the curriculum framework of AICTE, UGC and Anna university-Chennai. Further this Outcome Based Education (OBE) is designed with Choice Based Credit and Semester System (CBCSS) enabling the learners to gain professional competency with multi-disciplinary approach catering the minimum requirement of Lead Societies like IEEE, IET, ISTE and other Professional Bodies as per the Engineering NBA. In addition, the curriculum and syllabi are designed in a structured approach by deploying Feedback Mechanism on Curriculum from various stakeholders viz. Industry, Potential Employers, Alumni, Academia, Professional Bodies, Research Organizations and Parents to capture their voice of the respective stakeholders. The Curriculum design, delivery, and assessment, the three major pillars of the academic system, is completely aligned in line with Outcome Based Education (OBE) to assess and evaluate the learning outcomes facilitating the learners to achieve their Professional and Career Accomplishments.

The Project focus is the meaningful and purposeful involvement of the students on campus. “Quality education is every student’s birth right” and all systems have to empower the students, the custodians of the planet. To prepare them for tomorrow’s world, driven by knowledge, machine-intelligence and digital pathways, we want to groom our millennials to leverage the limitless opportunities. We have created a platform for deep research orientation, innovation and incubation to establish a robust academic ambience in the ecosystem. We would like to create impact through addressing academia-industry linkages, cross disciplinary initiative’s by Industrial collaborations.

“Continuation of life on the planet, making our world more sustainable, healthy, secure and joyful,” KNCET’ student community being epicenter of this wellness program, ready to present in a humble way, the captured imagination of the global engineering community and to showcase in the website their innovation, talent building, research, creative project experience, multidisciplinary training, entrepreneurial mindset.
