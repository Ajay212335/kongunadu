    <p1>
        The Department of Biomedical Engineering was established in the year 2020 with an intake of 60 to address the prevailing health sector challenges. This four year degree programme will nurture the young minds with fundamental knowledge of Biological sciences such as Human Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Microbiology. With this the student would also gain knowledge about Electronics, Measurements and Instrumentation to Design, Analyze, Synthesize and Evaluate the Diagnostic and Therapeutic equipments such as X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, Ventilators, Pacemakers, Dialyzer to serve the Medical community. The students will be guided to have periodical visits to the hospitals for bridging the gap between the class room learning and the real time issues.

Prosthetic devices for the physically challenged, Therapeutic equipments to replace the conventional medicines will also be part of the learning to this stream of engineers. This department has a well established relationship with industrial experts and physicians of different expertise to keep it updated and live up to the expectations of the contemporary world.

Through “ZYGOTE” association, the department organizes Guest Lectures, Workshops and Seminars on recent trends to enhance the technical knowledge and equip the skills of students.  A committee on Anti-Drugs arranges awareness programs at regular intervals to address the adverse effects. Students are appreciated to have exposure to on field trainings like Hospital Training, Industrial Visits, Internships, NPTEL courses, IIT spoken tutorials, Value Added Courses and Onsite projects in various reputed organizations.

The department has signed 2 MoUs with organizations like Thangam Hospital - Namakkal and Mothercell Regenerative Private Limited (MRC) – Tiruchirappalli to carry out Faculty Training Programs, Internship/Industrial Visit/In-Plant, Hospital Training, Projects and Consultancy.
